1. choose your own system, and ask ChatGPT to change the this equation to an equation relevant for whatever you choose

 # Δv = I_sp * g₀ * ln(m_i/m_f)  — Tsiolkovsky
# For the AK-12, use muzzle energy: E_k = 0.5 m v²

so I used the PL15 rocket equation to get the F35 leading edge equation; but, well ChatGPT rejected the PL15 rocket equation for Ak12 without changing Tsiolkovsky's rocket equation to Tsiolkovsky; let's try on F-35 or M4, then keep changing, F-22?

3. turn this as much as you can into a realistic computational aided design upgrade for the AK12; ensure that detailed prints to debug, print result when done, then print how it attempts to optimize the  AK12 through which math equation and why:
